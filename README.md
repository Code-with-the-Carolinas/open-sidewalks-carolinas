# open-sidewalks-carolinas
This repository is for Code with the Carolinas volunteers to contribute to work related to our Open Sidewalks project. We chose GitHub to host this project because significant work on Open Sidewalks and AccessMap has already been done on GitHub, and because the Open Sidewalks project has existing ties to Microsoft (through Bing Streetside data).
